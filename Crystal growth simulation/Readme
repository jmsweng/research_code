Simulates crystal growth by drawing circles which expand at a constant rate which appear at random (nucleation) times and random positions.
Mostly used to generate illustrations to show the effect of changing crystal growth model parameters.
Includes generates .csv files which represent volume crystallized as well as animations created from output images
