Miscelaneous code from my PhD work that may be useful in some way in the future.

Notes:
-Code that assembles reciprocal space volume from 2D x-ray images assumes instrument movement is perfect, it probably shouldn't do that.
-Algorithm for determining crystal growth dimensionality without KJMA model is included in "Heat peak fitting stuff.ipynb"
